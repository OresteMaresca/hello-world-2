# hello-world-2
This is the master version.
I added some control software that works.
As I´m Bob, I continue my work in my control software, unaware of Peter work. Remember thar Peter create a branch of my version (lines 1,2 and 3) and added a fourth line with his own code.
Here I continue adding control software, without Peter´s code. 
Now comes Peter´s code. Added more control software. I tested it and it worked.
